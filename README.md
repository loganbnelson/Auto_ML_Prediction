# Auto_ML_Prediction
Machine Learning project that takes in one or two csv files by the user, requests specific setting options, and then produces predicted values for a single "Y" column of data.

Included is an example output of two histograms. This is an example of predicted model results compared to the train data fed to the program. This is an automated output of the program meant to help check the similarity of the output. If not similar in distribution at all or exactly matching, the model may be under or over fitted.
