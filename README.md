# Auto_ML_Prediction
Machine Learning project that takes in one or two csv files by the user, requests specific setting options, and then produces predicted values for a single "Y" column of data.

## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting an output value using machine learning models. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the process, from loading training and test data to making predictions. The primary focus is on regression tasks.
